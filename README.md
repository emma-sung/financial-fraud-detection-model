## 🔍 About

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to detect fraudulent financial transactions. By leveraging real-world transaction data, I developed and optimized classification models to identify fraudulent activities based on transaction features.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- **🔧 Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared transaction data for modeling.
- **✨ Feature Engineering:** Extracted meaningful insights from transaction attributes.
- **🧪 Model Training & Evaluation:** Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to classify fraudulent transactions.
- **📊 Performance Metrics:** Focused on precision, recall, and F1-score, with a special emphasis on minimizing false negatives.
- **💸 Fraud Analysis:** Analyzed the total fraudulent transaction amounts detected by each model.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Models were evaluated based on their ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
- Bar plot visualizations compared model performance across precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The total dollar amount of detected fraud was analyzed to understand the real-world impact of each model.
